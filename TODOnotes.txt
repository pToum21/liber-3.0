TODO: 

- limit ratings to one? (so user cannot overinflate ratings)
- make an admin role after deploy, make sure to leave a note when submitting project 3 the sign in details so this way Diarmuid/Meg can access an admin account and test it out

-ask Diarmuid what sensitive API key information is (criteria says to protect that)

- Deploy
=============================================

NOTES (can leave notes here detailing what you did):

    General notes: 
    
     -MAKE YOUR OWN .ENV SECRET
        (in .env file:
        SECRET=rvh8uvnufvhe8rvr
        )
        but make your own random string of letters and numbers


        To make an admin, change default to admin in User model (then change it back to user one you made one)

        Made it so you cannot make duplicate users anymore (unique email and username); to see this work, you must drop your old users collection in db first.

        color scheme: 
            offwhite: #f3f3ec
            forest green: #8abbb1
            black: #000000 or 'black'

        always git pull origin main when you get on and before you code to avoid git conflicts as much as possible

    

        front end: when making queries and mutations, dont just select all fields. Pay attention to what information you will be returning, because some are unnecessary.
        For example, when making the CREATE_USER mutation, i didn't select keptBooks, because they won't have any, so we don't need to retrieve or return that field for this mutation.

EXTRA CODE:


if (context.user) {
                try {
                    const user = await User.findById(context.user._id);

                    const newComment = {
                        userId: user._id,
                        comments,
                    };

                    const newReview = new Review({
                        // _id
                        userId: user._id,
                        comments: [newComment],
                        rating: rating,
                    });

                    // saves document into database (conmpass)
                    await newReview.save();

                    // Find the book by its _id and update it with the new review's _id

                    await updatedBook.save();

                    // Assuming you need to return the added review, fetch it back along with necessary book details
                    // Since reviews are now referenced by ID, fetch the detailed review directly if needed
                    const addedReview = await Review.findById(newReview._id);

                    if (!addedReview) {
                        console.error('Review not found after update');
                        throw new Error('Review not found after update');
                    }

                    // Structure the response as needed, including the bookId
                    const responseData = {
                        _id: addedReview._id,
                        title: updatedBook.title,
                        bookId: bookId, // Ensuring the bookId is included in the response
                        authors: updatedBook.authors,
                        image: updatedBook.image,
                        text: updatedBook.text,
                        reviews: [
                            {
                                _id: addedReview._id,
                                comments: addedReview.comments.map(comment => ({
                                    _id: comment._id,

                                })),
                                rating: addedReview.rating, // Include the rating here
                            }
                        ],
                    };

                    This is a sentence.
