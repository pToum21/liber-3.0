TODO: 

- limit ratings to one? (so user cannot overinflate ratings)

=============================================

NOTES (can leave notes here detailing what you did):

    General notes: 
    
     -MAKE YOUR OWN .ENV SECRET
        (in .env file:
        SECRET=rvh8uvnufvhe8rvr
        )
        but make your own random string of letters and numbers


        To make an admin, change default to admin in User model (then change it back to user one you made one)

        Made it so you cannot make duplicate users anymore (unique email and username); to see this work, you must drop your old users collection in db first.

        color scheme: 
            offwhite: #f3f3ec
            forest green: #8abbb1
            black: #000000 or 'black'

        always git pull origin main when you get on and before you code to avoid git conflicts as much as possible

    

        front end: when making queries and mutations, dont just select all fields. Pay attention to what information you will be returning, because some are unnecessary.
        For example, when making the CREATE_USER mutation, i didn't select keptBooks, because they won't have any, so we don't need to retrieve or return that field for this mutation.
