                Our team put in tireless work and countless hours to meet the deadline of this project. We must credit <a style={{color: '8abbb1', textDecoration:'none'}} href="https://gutendex.com">Gutendex</a> and <a style={{color: '8abbb1', textDecoration:'none'}}  href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenburg</a> for all of the book data that this application has. We were fortunate to make our own straight-forward database with the acquired data. Additionally, we would like to leave a special thank-you to our spectacular mentors, Diarmuid and Meg, without whom, we surely would not have gotten this far, nor gotten the know-how to build such a feat within the timeframe of our program. They clearly have a passion for software development, and we were even luckier that they have a passion for helping others learn and grow. Their passion, time, effort, and encouragement only pushed us to make a better project. So, to you two: <em>thank you.</em></p>

                    <p>Pasha G., a kind-mannered person, is always pushing forward with a good attitude. He is an avid fan of cars, TV, and all things technology. Also a fantasy fan, he's happy to make coding magic happen when he is not working his day-job in the realty industry or busy on the weekends. His profile picture looks nothing like him, but he likes it, so it is what it is.</p>

                    <p>Peyton T. is a dedicated developer as well as a talented musician. Along with playing <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>NBA 2K</em>, he genuinely enjoys coding. If there were more hours in a day, he would honestly find a way to code something. Our interactive reader was his creation, and for his first time really integrating such a feature, I'd say it was more than astounding what he was able to produce with our team.</p>

I just wanted to say that in all of my academic career, this is easily the best team I've been able to work with -- for the first time ever, I found a team whom I knew I could rely on to carry their weight. Thank you.</p>
